# dtairmovie
Java app that checks the flight duration and suggests the user which movies to watch.

## How it works
- You enter the duration of 6 movies and the duration of the flight (all in minutes). 
- The app suggests which movies you manage to watch before the flight ends.
- - There is a minus (-30) minutes handicap, for security reasons (takeoff/landing).
